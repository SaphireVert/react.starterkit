This is a [Meteor](https://meteor.com/) project bootstrapped made with [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the front-end.

## Getting Started

If not already done, [install the Meteor command-line tool](https://docs.meteor.com/install.html). (You will only need to do this once.)

Then, run the development server:

```bash
meteor npm i
meteor
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
